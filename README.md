# Hi there, I'm Nakul 👋

I’m a **Backend Engineer | DevOps** who loves building things that live on the internet. My goal is to bridge the gap between "it works" and "it's a joy to use." 

### ⚡ A Little About Me
* 🔭 I’m currently contributing to Rocket.chat, AsyncAPI and SugarLabs (GSOC)
* 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on **Open Source projects or innovative SaaS ideas**
* 💬 Ask me about **React, Node.js, or why the CSS 'z-index' is my mortal enemy**
* ⚡ Fun fact: I spend as much time naming variables as I do writing the logic.
